Hedwig (b. pre July 1991 - 27 July 1997) was Harry Potter's pet Snowy Owl (Bubo scandiacus).[3]

In August 1991 Hedwig was purchased from Eeylops Owl Emporium and was gifted to Harry from Rubeus Hagrid on his eleventh birthday. Owls are used by wizards to deliver mail, but Hedwig was also an important companion as Harry was initiated into the wizarding world. She continued to be one of his closest companions until her death in the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997.
